# Reflection by Christopher N. Wakim

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA'. This lab has been
by far the most difficalt lab. However, with the aid of several Teaching
Asistants, and my collouges I was able to complete it. I am progressing at a
consistant pace down my journey of computer science, and so far I am enjoying
everything I have learned.

This lab taught me the fundamental steps to incorperating random variables into
my programs. I now feel I have an established grasp on how to integrate random
variables into my programs. I also had many concepts reinforced, such as the
use of println statements, adding JavaDoc comments where needed, etc.

While this lab had presented me with the biggest challenge thus far, I enjoyed
learning how to manipulate a DNA string with random variables. While I did need
some help from the Teaching Assistants and my colluges I feel I am becoming
more proficcient as the class progresses. As I become more and more
proficcent, I enjoy the class more and more.
